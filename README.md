# Billwave

> Billing engine for AI SaaS.

\> Yes, the infra is built entirely on cloudflare stack. heavy use of Durable Objects and Workflows.

\> Yes, self hosting is pretty much easy and would run perfectly with free workers plan.

\> yes u can use /check as middleware, and maybe a smol cache on ur end. (the endpoint is average 175ms response time)

\> No, tests are not 100% of core data paths yet.

## What is Billwave?

Billwave is a developer-friendly billing engine that lets you implement subscriptions, usage-based billing, and feature gating.

Billwave supports multiple payment gateways while providing first-class features for:

- **Usage Metering** (track tokens, API calls, seats)
- **Flexible Resets** (minutes, hourly, daily, monthly quotas, yearly, custom)
- **Credit Systems** (shared balances across features)
- **Add-on** (purchased against credit systems, or could be plan based addons)
- **Multi-provider** payment provider is abstracted into an adapter mechanism. (currently implemented - Paystack, Stripe, Dodo Payments, Polar & Bachs)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install SDK
bun add @digvijay-x1/billwave
```

### 1. Define your features

Create a config file (e.g. `billwave.config.ts`) or run `bunx @digvijay-x1/billwave-cli init`.
define your features using metered(), boolean(), and entity():

```ts
import { metered, boolean, entity } from "@digvijay-x1/billwave";
apiCalls = metered("api-calls", { name: "API Calls" });
analytics = boolean("analytics", { name: "Analytics Dashboard" });
seats = entity("seats", { name: "Team Seats" });
```

### 2. Define your plans.

Define plans and configure features.

```ts
export default new Billwave({
  secretKey: process.env.BILLWAVE_SECRET_KEY!,
  catalog: [
    plan("starter", {
      name: "Starter",
      price: 0,
      currency: "NGN",
      interval: "monthly",
      autoEnable: true,
      features: [apiCalls.limit(1000), analytics.off(), seats.limit(3)],
    }),
    plan("pro", {
      name: "Pro",
      price: 500000,
      currency: "NGN",
      interval: "monthly",
      features: [
        apiCalls.limit(50000, { overage: "charge", overagePrice: 100 }),
        analytics.on(),
        seats.limit(20),
      ],
    }),
    plan("enterprise", {
      name: "Enterprise",
      price: 2000000,
      currency: "NGN",
      interval: "monthly",
      features: [apiCalls.unlimited(), analytics.on(), seats.unlimited()],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### 3. Sync to the API

Using the CLI

```bash
npx @digvijay-x1/billwave-cli sync --config ./billwave.config.ts
```

### 4. Runtime primitives.

This are the calls that would be sprinkled all over ur codebase.

```ts
// 1. Checkout (attach)
const { url } = await billwave.attach({
  customer: "user_123",
  product: "pro_plan",
});

// 2. Check access (check)
const { allowed } = await billwave.check({
  customer: "user_123",
  feature: "api_calls",
});

// 3. Track usage (track)
await billwave.track({
  customer: "user_123",
  feature: "api_calls",
  value: 1,
});
```

That's it. No webhooks (yet), no state syncing, no custom billig logic.

This entire project might not directly be a fork of [autumnpricing](https://github.com/useautumn/autumn), but has heavily taken concepts from their implementation. even UX of the dashboard.
