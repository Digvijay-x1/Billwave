 * Organization slugs that would collide with fixed URL segments.

 * would either shadow a route or be shadowed by one:
 *
 *   API        /webhooks/{slug}/{provider}      ← `sandbox` is the shared
 *                                                 managed-sandbox webhook URL
 *   Dashboard  /{slug}/plans, /{slug}/…         ← top-level dashboard routes
 *
 * Checked on create and update via Better Auth organization hooks, and by
 * `GET /api/organizations/slug-check/:slug` so the UI can say why.
