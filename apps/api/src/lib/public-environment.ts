/**
 * Public API environment handling.
 *
 * Billwave runs one worker deployment per environment:
 *   - sandbox  -> https://sandbox.billwave.example  (ENVIRONMENT = "test" | "development")
 *   - live     -> https://api.billwave.example      (ENVIRONMENT = "live" | "production")
 *
 * API keys are scoped to an environment via their prefix:
 *   - billwave_sk_test_... -> sandbox only
 *   - billwave_sk_live_... -> live only
 *   - billwave_sk_...      -> legacy, accepted by both (issued before scoping existed)
 *
 * The prefix is authoritative and tamper-proof: the full key string is hashed
 * for lookup, so changing the prefix invalidates the key.
